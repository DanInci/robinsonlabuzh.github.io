# Robinson lab website

This is a template that we forked from [here](https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template) for the basic structure and added many components.

More details on making HTML documents from Rmarkdown can be found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).

### Updates to the website

- Once you've cloned the repo and have all the packages installed, the updating the website is done via:

```
rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = "UTF-8")
```

- Then, commit and push everything back to the robinsonlab.github.io repo

### Adding publications

### Adding members

### Adding news item

## Two examples

You can see for example 
- [my own website](https://privefl.github.io/),
- [the website of the R user group in Grenoble](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).
