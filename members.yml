  description: "As a postdoctoral research associate, one of my main interests is the 
  development and improvement of statistical methods and workflows, currently mainly 
  in the field of RNA-seq. I am also interested in the process of evaluating and 
  comparing methods in an objective, robust and reproducible manner.

  description: "I am a postdoctoral research associate working on the development of cutting-edge statistical methods for RNA-seq data.
  In particular, I am currently focusing on a Bayesian hierarchical model to detect genes showing differential transcript usage (DTU);  
  the method accounts for the subject-to-subject variability in the transcripts proportions and for the uncertainty in the allocation 
  of each fragment to the corresponding transcript, which is treated as a latent variable.
  In general terms, my interests are quite broad and lie in  the development of statistical methods for applications in the medical and biological fields.
